          <p>
            Zenitsu Agatsuma is one of the main protagonists of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and along with Inosuke Hashibira, a travelling companion of Tanjiro Kamado and Nezuko Kamado. He is also a Demon Slayer in the Demon Slayer
            Corps.
          </p>

          <p>
            Zenitsu is a young boy of average height with fair skin and downward-sloped scared-looking eyes that fade from soft brown to gold. He has short, yellow hair of varying lengths, cutting off squarely at the ends where it fades to
            a darker orange color, that falls in front of his face in uneven bangs. Before he became a Demon Slayer, Zenitsu's hair was originally black, but it turned the color it is currently when he was struck by lightning during his
            training.
          </p>
          <p>For some time following the battle at Mount Natagumo, his limbs temporarily shrunk due to the Spider Demon (Son)'s poison but were able to return to normal afterward thanks to the medicine given to him by Shinobu Kocho.</p>
          <p>
            He wears a paler brown version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform, which consists of a dark brown gakuran jacket, a white belt around his waist and hakama pants that extend, as well as his signature white-triangle patterned,
            yellow and orange gradient haori. As well as this, Zenitsu also sports a pair of Kyahan, tied at the front in 3 white bows, with the same pattern as his haori, pale brown tabi socks and white-laced zōri.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Demon Slayer, Zenitsu around a standard sized and shaped Nichirin katana with lightning streaks along the entire blade. His sword's hilt is circular shaped with 4 slight indentations, the center has a silver tone with small
            triangles and has a golden border. The handle is white with several yellow triangles going down it. The base of the handle is gold with two short, white ribbons hanging off it. With his katana, Zenitsu has a standard sword
            sheath that is white in color.

          <h3>About Zenitsu</h3>
          <img src="img/side.jpg" alt="Zenitsu Agatsuma" />
          <p>
            Zenitsu comes off as a coward, as he often claims that he doesn't have long to live due to the dangerous job of being a Demon Slayer. He also has rather low self-esteem despite his strength, even considering himself useless as
            seen when he couldn't believe he had slain a demon and tricked himself into instead believing that it was Shoichi, even though the latter was a young child who didn't possess any form of special demon-slaying ability
